# Blog CMS Project

This project involved the development of a dynamic Blog Content Management System (CMS) web application, built using the Django framework. The primary objective was to create a fully functional and modern blogging platform that integrates essential content management features with interactive user functionalities and administrative tools.


--> Key Features:

(1)User Management: Secure user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities. Each user has a dedicated profile page displaying their posts and public information.

(2)Content Management: Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete blog posts with rich content support, including image uploads.

(3)User Engagement: Features such as a like, comment, and bookmark system allow users to interact with posts and save their favorites. Users can also follow/unfollow other users to stay updated with their content.

(4)Moderation: A post reporting system is in place for administrative review of inappropriate content. An admin panel allows managing all posts, reports, and users.

(5)Search and Filter: Implemented search and filter functionalities to help users find specific content or users.

(6)User Interface: Includes a dark mode option and a responsive, intuitive UI designed for seamless interaction.


--> Technology Stack: The project utilizes Python 3 and the Django web framework for robust backend implementation. Frontend development involves HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and Jinja templates. Data       persistence is managed with SQLite (for development) and MySQL (for deployment).


This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of modern web application architecture, UI/UX principles, and data-driven functionality, resulting in a feature-rich, production-ready blogging platform.
